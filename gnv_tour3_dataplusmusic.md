# The #GamesNightViz Tour: The Sound of Games with #DataPlusMusic

Welcome back!

On our last stop on the tour [we joined Sarah Bartlett's #IronQuest project to relive some Nostalgic Games](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/gnv_tour2_nostalgia_ironquest.md). 

For our next challenge, we're tuning into Sean Miller's #DataPlusMusic to listen to The Sound of Games.

Weâ€™re challenging you to visualise your favourite games inspired music and sounds, be it the soundtrack, famous voice actors or the most challenge tracks to beat.
