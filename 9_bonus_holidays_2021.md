# Bonus Level: Notable Holiday Games

Seasons greetings #GamesNightViz -ers! 

To celebrate the holiday season, the #GamesNightViz team have assembled a bonus data visualisation challenge. 

For this task, we will be visualising some notable games that are either holiday-themed, are set around the holidays or include the holidays as part of the plot. 

Games here range from Cthulhu Saves Christmas, in which the master of insanity, Cthulhu, has lost his powers and the only way he can get them back is by rescuing Santa Claus. To the bonus mission Hitman (2016), "Holiday Hoarders", where agent 47  is tasked to eliminate two thieves, Harry Bagnato and Marv Gonif, who are stealing Christmas presents - based on the 1990 film "Home Alone".

This is not a complete list. If you have a holiday favourite that's missing please include it in your visualisation! We always love seeing people sharing the games they enjoy.
