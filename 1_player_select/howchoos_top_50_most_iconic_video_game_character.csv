14,"Yoshi ","https://howchoo.com/media/zt/ky/nd/yoshi.jpeg?width=900&auto=webp&quality=70","Super Mario World","1990","It's Yoshi—the lovable dinosaur sidekick of Mario and Luigi! First appearing in Dinosaur Land in the Super Mario World game, Yoshi became one of the first rideable characters in a video game. He can grab objects with his tongue, spit them out aflame, or lay them into an egg thrown by the player. Besides being a side character in various Mario games, he has his own set of games as well, where he features as the main character. He's also a trendy character to play in the Mario Kart series. Yoshi has to be the most recognizable video game dragon, even if he is more cute than scary!","Designers originally intended Yoshi to be in the original Super Mario Bros. and even made drawings of him for the game. However, the processing limitations at the time prevented adding a rideable character to the game.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

There was some careful writing of the dialogue in the game to maintain a gender-neutral atmosphere for the player. And really, that reflects a lot of what makes Commander Shepard so popular with gamers. She/He is a kind of blank canvas, on which the player can customize a character that feels the most enjoyable with which to play the game. Mass Effect also happens to one of the best video games of all time and certainly one of the best-written games ever made. And it's that compelling storyline, one that is character-driven like a great novel, that seals Commander Shepard as one of video gaming's great protagonists. ","When deciding on what to name the character, developers chose to honor astronaut Alan Shepard, the first American to travel into space.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

Agent 47 is actually a clone from the DNA of five different men, each with certain physical and mental attributes. He can be controlled by another agent, who is the player. This doesn't leave him with much of a personality, of course, which makes him all the more attractive to many fans. He has one mission: to kill his target—though if he enjoys his work, we would never know it!","The actual location of Agent 47's safehouse has never been revealed in any of the Hitman games thus far.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

And Pikachu has done just that! Pikachu is an electric-type Pokémon in the video games.  One big reason for the pokémon's popularity is that he is the partner of Ash Ketchum as the starter Pokémon in the anime series. Another likely reason is that Pikachu is just so darn cute! And it doesn't hurt when you have your own film made about you (Pokémon Detective Pikachu), and you're voiced by Ryan Reynolds. ","Pikachu was one of ten Japanese mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

Geralt is a magical demon hunter known as a ""Witcher"" and possesses magical abilities through genetic mutations. While the video game doesn't explore Geralt of Rivia in as much depth as the television show or the novels, players learn about the training he received to be a ""Witcher"" and his quests. However, if you really want the full experience of the character, you'll need to combine gameplay with some TV binging!","For many, Geralt of Rivia is more known for his appearances in short stories and novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.

9,"Master Chief ","https://howchoo.com/media/md/e2/zm/master-chief.jpeg?width=900&auto=webp&quality=70","Halo: Combat Evolved","2001","The supersoldier protagonist of the Halo series of games, Master Chief holds a special place in the hearts of anyone who grew up on the iconic shooting game franchise. He's often compared with Superman and Spiderman in terms of his character and motivation. He's a protector and about as tough as they come. One of the most surprising things about players' love for the Chief is that Master Chief rarely speaks in the games. That love probably stems from allowing the players themselves to really be Master Chief and speak for them in their own minds. ","The only time Master Chief's face can be seen is when beating Halo 4 on the highest difficulty. A cut scene will briefly show his eyes as he removes his helmet.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

He is a Japanese martial artist based on real-life karate master—Mas Oyama. Over time, Ryu evolved into a more muscular figure with a widening array of attacks and defensive moves in the series. He's likely the most iconic fighting-game character of all time. In the 1994 film version of the game, Ryu is played by Byron Mann, and both Ryu and his brother Ken have found their way into many animated films and shorts, as well. Ryu is famous for the misquote: ""You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance."" ","Ryu's Hadouken (or energy-ball attack) was inspired by the sci-fi anime series Space Battleship Yamato from the 1970s, which the game designer used to watch as a kid.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"
7,"Mega Man ","https://howchoo.com/media/yw/ex/nz/mega-man.jpeg?width=900&auto=webp&quality=70","Mega Man","1987","Some may point out that there are several Mega Mans, so maybe he shouldn't be on the list. But we include him as one character from the classic video game series from Capcom, Mega Man. Mega Man is the bionic hero who dashes, jumps really high, and shoots energy pulses out of his arm cannon. And if you played games back in the day, he was a fixture on your video game cartridge shelf. In each new version of the game (and there have been many), Mega Man gains new abilities and new attributes to enhance him and the gameplay. He's a classic and has to be in the top 10 of any list of famous video game characters. ","A unique gameplay feature that Mega Man began was the ability to steal weapons and their features from downed robot enemies. This offered choices and reward to the players for taking down their foes. Now, it's a standard element in many RPGs and side-scrollers.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

Link, on the other hand, is the sword-fighting, arrow-shooting hero of the games that the player controls. He wields legendary swords, such as the Master Sword, in the various games and uses other legendary artifacts to complete his quests. What makes Link so iconic is, of course, the uniqueness of the video game series itself, as well as his status as the classic coming-of-age hero. He's pure in many ways and has no dialogue, except for a few grunts and groans, in the games. Still, players love Link, maybe more than even Zelda! It also makes our list of best video game by year of birth an impressive four times!","The name Link was chosen because designers wanted Link to connect the ""Triforce,"" three computer chips that symbolized different periods of time.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

Some diehard Sega fans would argue that Sonic (aka The Blue Blur) should be number one on our list. Certainly, there's certainly a case to be made for that too, particularly given the latest movie starring the hedgehog with sneakers, Sonic the Hedgehog, starring Jim Carey as Doctor Eggman. Sonic has appeared in five different games, which isn't a lot given his popularity. Though Sega has all but shut down operations, Sonic remains popular even with new gamers. Currently, Sonic the Hedgehog games are available as a package in SEGA Classics. ","The Sonic figure's first actual appearance in a game was as a dashboard decoration in the game Rad Mobile, a racing game released in 1991.","howchoo.com","2021-05-15"

He's also one of the few video game characters that began as a villain of sorts and became a protagonist in later games. He won many hearts when he debuted in 3D in Donkey Kong Country and has since become one of Nintendo's most iconic characters. Donkey Kong was certainly based on King Kong from Universal Studios, with the latter even suing Nintendo over trademark infringement. (Universal lost the case.) And there's something loveable about each of the great apes.

And it's not hard to see what made her so popular with video gamers. It's her...ummm...killer boots of course! In all seriousness, she was one of the first female video game characters to shed some classic stereotypes. She's well educated and can kick butt with the best of them. And developers have evolved her character over time to move away from the obvious sex appeal of the character to highlight those other attributes that make Lara Croft a favorite with fans. As the daughter of an archeologist, Lara's main quest in life is to discover answers to the disappearances of her mother and father. She explores tombs in the faraway places of the world, searching for clues and some really cool ancient artifacts.

So what's so appealing about a yellow circle that eats up little dots? Well, it turns out that Namco, who owns the rights to Pac-Man, gave him an entire backstory. He's a family man, married to Mrs. Pac-Man, with two kids. In later games, he has a kind and adventurous personality that really embodies the video game industry as a whole. Heck, even Mario creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, claims that Pac-Man is his favorite videogame character!","Pac-Man has even found his way into business lingo.

Mario has come to be more than just a famous video character; he represents video games as a whole and even...well...America as a whole. Mario's not your typical video game hero. He doesn't wield a sword or have a fancy outfit. He's just a plumber and dresses the part. I guess that's why we love him so much. He reminds us of the everyman from the Mushroom Kingdom who just wants to find his love. To date, Mario has appeared in more than 200 video games for the Nintendo franchise, giving him the record for the most video game appearances.
