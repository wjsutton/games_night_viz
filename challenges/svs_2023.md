# Is it a Sport or a Game? with #SportsVizSunday

Welcome back and happy new year!

To start the new year we're teaming up with #SportsVizSunday to answer the question, "When is a sport a sport and a game a game?". If you've seen the [Netflix series "We Are the Champions"](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81034679) you'll see what is considered a sport is changing - with games being very much a part of this change. To help answer the question we've got datasets exploring the crossover between games and sports. 

We're challenging you to visualise games that could be sports, and sports that might be called games. 

 - Many consider Tiddlywinks to be a children's game but did you know there's a world championship? 
 - eSports are becoming more mainstream but what are top-earning games for eSports professionals? 
 - The idea of having a beer and running sounds like a drinking game but are they much slower than professional athletes?

### Bonus: Iron Viz Leftovers

Back in 2022, the theme for [Iron Viz was games and sports](https://www.tableau.com/community/iron-viz). If you entered Iron Viz but didn't finish your submission or have an idea that you didn't submit use this challenge to explore that idea or finish that viz.
