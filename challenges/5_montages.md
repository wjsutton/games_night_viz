Or choose one of the data sets from the [#GamesNightViz Data Archive :floppy_disk:](data_archive.md)

### Legendary difficulty - bring your own data

For those considering the Legendary difficulty (bring your own data), here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Are there games that you‚Äôve played that were challenging to start with?
- What games competitions have you seen? Were there any strategies you tried in your next playthrough?
- Are there any gamers you admire for their skill or creativity in a game you enjoy?

Looking for data sets? [Check out Sarah Bartlett's Twitter thread for data sources](https://twitter.com/sarahlovesdata/status/1445006106116374539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) or check out the [#GamesNightViz Data Archive :floppy_disk:](data_archive.md)

| Data set Difficulty | Description |
|---|---|
| Casual | For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available |
| Normal | A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations |
| Heroic | A large data set for those with more time available  |
| Legendary | Expand on the data provided by bringing new data to the project |

### Inspiration from the Tableau community

Here are some vizzes to check out for inspiration. 

Your content may be different but focus on the choices the authors have made in presenting the data, what would you do differently? And what aspects would you like to emulate?

## Visual design challenge: Whitespace

## Data preparation challenge: Cleaning weapons data

Over the last few months, the team have been playing Elden Ring which has inspired this challenge. 

We‚Äôre looking for the highest damaging weapons we can use throughout our playthrough. Using data tables from https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Weapons we have the base stats for all the melee weapons however, it‚Äôs a little messy! 

### Task
The goal is to create an output of the highest damaging weapon by its required level.

1. Load the dataset
2. Split the dataset into two tables:
- Damage Stats: 1 containing: Name, Category, Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy
- Level Requirements: 1 containing: Name, Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc

For Damage Stats, if you look at the data in Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy:
- the first value shows the attack damage 
- the second value shows the damage resistance
- A dash ‚Äú-‚Äù means 0, i.e. no damage 

For Level Requirements, for Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc:
- the first value shows the level required
- the second value shows the weapon scaling rating
- A dash ‚Äú-‚Äù means 0, i.e. no requirement or scaling 

3. Pivot the two datasets:
For Damage Stats,1 column containing Phy, Mag, Fire, Ligh, Holy and 1 for the values
For Level Requirements,1 column containing Str, Dex, Int, Fai, Arc and 1 for the values

4. Split the pivot values into 2 columns for both tables:
For Damage Stats label the first column ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù, and the second ‚ÄúDamage Resistance‚Äù
For Level Requirements label the first column ‚ÄúRequired Attribute‚Äù, and the second ‚ÄúAttribute Scaling‚Äù 

5. Replace the ‚Äú-‚Äù values with zero in the columns: ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDamage Resistance‚Äù, ‚ÄúRequired Attribute‚Äù and change the datatype to whole numbers (integer)
6. Find the total ‚ÄúAttack Damage‚Äù and total ‚ÄúRequired Attribute‚Äù for all weapons and join the datasets together.
7. Rank the weapons by total attack damage, grouped by the total required attribute. 
8. Filter for the number 1 rank and output the data

**Bonus**

Following up on my Tableau Prep TUG talk, I spoke about improving prep flows by reducing the complexity and avoiding repeated steps. 

If you‚Äôve followed the guide above you would have split the dataset into two datasets, and then performed similar data transformations to both datasets.

Can you think of a way you could avoid splitting the dataset? By doing so you‚Äôll avoid creating duplicated calculations a join?  

I faced a similar problem in my Iron Viz rebuild, in which I repeated calculations transformation for different streams in my Tableau Prep workflow, you can see how I removed the complexity here: [https://youtu.be/fAGFYm9gWng?t=3801](https://youtu.be/fAGFYm9gWng?t=3801)
