### Legendary difficulty - bring your own data

For those considering the Legendary difficulty (bring your own data), here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Are there games that youâ€™ve played that were challenging to start with?
- What games competitions have you seen? Were there any strategies you tried in your next playthrough?
- Are there any gamers you admire for their skill or creativity in a game you enjoy?

Looking for data sets? [Check out Sarah Bartlett's Twitter thread for data sources](https://twitter.com/sarahlovesdata/status/1445006106116374539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) or check out the [#GamesNightViz Data Archive :floppy_disk:](data_archive.md)

| Data set Difficulty | Description |
|---|---|
| Casual | For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available |
| Normal | A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations |
| Heroic | A large data set for those with more time available  |
| Legendary | Expand on the data provided by bringing new data to the project |

### Inspiration from the Tableau community

Here are some vizzes to check out for inspiration. 

Your content may be different but focus on the choices the authors have made in presenting the data, what would you do differently? And what aspects would you like to emulate?
