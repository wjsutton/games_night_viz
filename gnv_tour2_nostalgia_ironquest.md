# The #GamesNightViz Tour: Nostalgic Games with #IronQuest

Welcome back!

Earlier on the tour [we joined our friends at #DataFamCon & #PreppinData for a game of Dungeons and Dragons](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/gnv_tour1_dnd_datafamcon.md). 

For our next challenge, we'll be reliving some Nostalgic Games with [Sarah Bartlett](https://twitter.com/sarahlovesdata)'s [#IronQuest](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23IronQuest&src=typed_query&f=top), a community data visualisation project following the Iron Viz style format allowing participants to showcase best practices & skill in design, storytelling & analysis.

We’re challenging you to take a trip down memory lane to visualise data relating to the games you used to play in your childhood. Whether that be video games, board games, card games or even school playground games, we can’t wait to see what you come up with for this challenge!

## Data visualisation challenge
