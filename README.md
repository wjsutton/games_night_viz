# Introducing #GamesNightViz

#GamesNightViz is a monthly Tableau community project focusing on using data from your favourite games to improve your skills with data visualisation, data preparation and visual design, and maybe a winning strategy for your next game night (no guarantees! :wink:)

### The Goal

Working with datasets from your favourite games we'll build and develop a portfolio of real world data skills including
- Data visualisation 
- Data preparation 
- Design techniques

### The Project

Each month, we will have a theme and a range of datasets available, with a challenge to prepare one of the datasets and a principle of design to focus on. Datasets will come with a difficulty scale to help those newer to data visualisation or those with limited time to practice. We will be sharing our creations with the #datafam and the wider teaching community.

**Difficulty scaled datasets** 
- Casual - For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available
- Normal - A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations
- Heroic - A large data set for those with more time available
- Legendary - Bring your own data, [#IronQuest](https://sarahlovesdata.co.uk/category/iron-quest/) style

There will also be two bonus 'Special Ops' tasks on:
- Data preparation - Recreate one of the datasets using a tool or coding language, [Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) style
- Visual design - A design technique to practice in your data visualisation, supported with some online tools

For this project you can choose which challenges you undertake depending on what you want to learn, e.g. you may want to focus on Design + a dataset, alternatively, you may want to just learn data preparation with a new coding language or tool. 

**What Type of Games?**

All of them! 

At #GamesNightViz we love all types of games: card games, board games, video games, party games, game shows, the list goes on!

### The Challenges 

Season 1 of #GamesNightViz will consist of 6 sets of challenges released monthly.

### House Rules

- Make sure it 'sparks joy' 
- Support your fellow #GamesNightViz participents
- Make time for yourselves away from the project

There's no expectation to complete all the tasks or participate every month. This project is designed to inspire you to develop new skills and build a portfolio showcasing what you've learnt, not be a chore or something that doesn't spark joy.

**Will Sutton**<br><br>I'm Will, an avid fan of games of all kinds. I've been working with data for over 10 years and now work as a Senior Data Analyst, working with data and stakeholders to inform business decisions. 

I owe a large amount of my career development down to passion projects; either part of the Tableau community, producing insights for my running club, or just questions I wanted to know the answers to.

**Tina Covelli**<br><br>I'm Tina and I've been in the data visualization space since 2015 and a gamer for life! I joined the #datafam and Tableau Public community in 2021 and it has been such a welcoming experience.  

I am very passionate about both topics and am excited at the opportunity to work with Will and Louis to bring this passion forward for all!

**Louis Yu**<br><br>Hi, Louis here! Have been working in various industries in the past decade but finally found my way into the video game industry as a Senior Data Analyst, driving customer insights and building dashboards for 2K Games.

I spent a good chunk of my growing up playing games as I always enjoy a good jRPG or anything with an immersive narrative. Which probably explains why I am fascinated by the storytelling potential of data vizzes!

Most of my work revolves around Tableau and Adobe (Iâ€™m not a full-fledged designer, but I know enough to pull my own weight)
