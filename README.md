# Introducing #GamesNightViz

#GamesNightViz is a monthly Tableau community project focusing on using data from your favourite games to improve your skills with data visualisation, data preparation and visual design, and maybe a winning strategy for your next game night (no guarantees! :wink:)

### The Goal

Working with datasets from your favourite games we'll build and develop a portfolio of real world data skills including
- Data visualisation 
- Data preparation 
- Design techniques

### The Project

Each month, we will have a theme and a range of datasets available, with a challenge to prepare one of the datasets and a principle of design to focus on. Datasets will come with a difficulty scale to help those newer to data visualisation or those with limited time to practice. We will be sharing our creations with the #datafam and the wider teaching community.

**Difficulty scaled datasets** 
- Casual - For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available
- Normal - A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations
- Heroic - A large data set for those with more time available
- Legendary - Bring your own data, [#IronQuest](https://sarahlovesdata.co.uk/category/iron-quest/) style

There will also be two bonus 'Special Ops' tasks on:
- Data preparation - Recreate one of the datasets using a tool or coding language, [Preppin' Data](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) style
- Visual design - A design technique to practice in your data visualisation, supported with some online tools

For this project you can choose which challenges you undertake depending on what you want to learn, e.g. you may want to focus on Design + a dataset, alternatively, you may want to just learn data preparation with a new coding language or tool. 

### The Golden Rule

There's no expectation to complete all the tasks or participate every month. This project is designed to inspire you to develop new skills and build a portfolio showcasing what you've learnt, not be a chore or something that doesn't spark joy.
