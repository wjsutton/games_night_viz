# Level 2: Hello World

Welcome back!

Earlier in [Level 1](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/1_player_select.md) we selected our players, now we enter into the world of the game. For our next theme we’re saying “Hello World” as we attempt to navigate the game world and leverage data to increase our chances of winning. 

Finding our way around a new place can be challenging so any data we have would be invaluable, and from this data we may want to find out:
- Where are the best items?
- Where’s the safest place for me to stay?
- Where can I find the best companions?


## The Challenges

Below are **three challenges** for you to choose from:
- [**Visualising data**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/2_hello_world.md#data-visualisation-challenge) about our various game **WORLDS**, with datasets ranging from the landscapes of Minecraft to the depth of ocean warfare in battleship
- [**Boldly**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/2_hello_world.md#visual-design-challenge-font) stepping into the world of **FONTS**, with tools to help you pick the perfect font combo and deploy it in your viz
- [**Preparing data**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/2_hello_world.md#data-preparation-challenge-cliam-brown-sunk-my-battleship) to **SURVIVE** against CLiam Browns Battleship AI, with steps to follow along the way

Submissions 
- Deadline is midnight PST 13th February 2022, level 3 will be released shortly afterwards
- Post your submissions on Twitter with the hashtag [#GamesNightViz](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GamesNightViz&src=typed_query&f=top), and tag the team [@WJSutton12](https://twitter.com/WJSutton12), [@Visual_Endgame](https://twitter.com/Visual_Endgame), [@ninjavizlouis](https://twitter.com/ninjavizlouis) so we don't miss your great work!
- Submit your work the project tracker here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqFaHnRcX2uBX7h5PkbigXim1kfQMsnC7ZloF8UvxzfRog4w/viewform?usp=sf_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqFaHnRcX2uBX7h5PkbigXim1kfQMsnC7ZloF8UvxzfRog4w/viewform?usp=sf_link)

**Stuck for Ideas? Here are some questions you could try to answer:**
- [Minecraft:](2_hello_world/minecraft_blocks_simplified_version.csv) Where can you find the best resources in Minecraft? Are there any potential dangers at these levels?
- [Super Mario Bros:](2_hello_world/super_mario_bros_levels.xlsx) How many enemies must Mario face to save the princess in Super Mario Bros?
- [PUBG:](2_hello_world/pubg_single_player_erangel_sample.csv) Where are the most dangerous places to land in PUBG’s Erangel map?


### Legendary difficulty - bring your own data

For those considering the Legendary difficulty (bring your own data), here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Do you have a favourite map/board/location from a game you enjoy? 
- Do you have a game that is played worldwide, e.g. The World Series of Beer Pong [https://bpong.com/wsobp/](https://bpong.com/wsobp/)
- Or perhaps you may want to explore some of the best games in the world, e.g. The Game of the Year awards [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_the_Year_awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_of_the_Year_awards)  


Looking for data sets? [Check out Sarah Bartlett's Twitter thread for data sources](https://twitter.com/sarahlovesdata/status/1445006106116374539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

| Data set Difficulty | Description |
|---|---|
| Casual | For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available |
| Normal | A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations |
| Heroic | A large data set for those with more time available  |
| Legendary | Expand on the data provided by bringing new data to the project |

### Inspiration from the Tableau community

Here are some vizzes to check out for inspiration. 

Your content may be different but focus on the choices the authors have made in presenting the data, what would you do differently? And what aspects would you like to emulate?

## Visual design challenge: Font

In this challenge we'll be **BOLDLY** stepping into the world of fonts.

We’ve put together a blog post on how to use fonts intentionally and challenge you to try it out this month. 
   
Read Tina’s post [How to Pick the Perfect Font](https://visualendgame.wixsite.com/tinacovelli/post/how-to-pick-the-perfect-font)

### Task 

When creating your visualization, use 1-2 fonts max throughout the entire visualization. In place of using several fonts, use stylistic techniques mentioned in the post above such as (but not limited to): bolding, italicizing, spacing, color, etc. Create a visualization and narrative with a very intentional approach to fonts.

You can use any tools you’d like. A few of our favorites are:
- For font discovery: Adobe fonts
- For crafting text: Figma, PowerPoint, or Illustrator

If you are planning to use non-native Tableau Public fonts, the post includes supporting material for different tools to use: [How to Pick the Perfect Font](https://visualendgame.wixsite.com/tinacovelli/post/how-to-pick-the-perfect-font)

When picking your fonts you may want to consider how accessible they are for your audience, this Medium post from The Readability Group gives a good overview on font accessibility:
[A Guide to Understanding What Makes a Typeface Accessible](https://medium.com/the-readability-group/a-guide-to-understanding-what-makes-a-typeface-accessible-and-how-to-make-informed-decisions-9e5c0b9040a0) gives a great overview and introduction.

### Inspiration from the Tableau community

Check out the use of font in these three vizzes.

- the style of font(s)
- the font hierarchies
- how color has been incorporated

## Data preparation challenge: C.Liam Brown Sunk my Battleship 

C.Liam Brown has built an AI to play Battleship, and it's very effective, but can we learn from previous matches where the safest squares are to give us a better chance of winning?

Special thanks to C.Liam Brown for supplying the data, try a game against the AI: [https://cliambrown.com/battleship/play.php](https://cliambrown.com/battleship/play.php)


### Task

Find the top 10 safest squares in Battleship, where safety is a square occupied by a player’s ship which has the highest win rate by the player. An overview of the full dataset has been provided here: [Github/cliambrown](https://github.com/cliambrown/battleship-data), this task works from the battleship_game_squares.csv dataset.

1. [Input the data](data_prep/input_level_2_battleship_squares.csv)
2. Filter ai_mode_id = 3 (the AI Learning mode)
3. Create columns for the grid row and column for each square
- e.g. row 1 will include squares 1-10, row 2 includes squares 11-20, etc.
- and column 1 will contain 1, 11, 21, etc.
4. Filter for squares that the player occupies, ai_ships == 0
5. Reduce data set to ai_win, square, games, row, & column
6. Create column, games won by ai, i.e. ai_win * games
7. Create an aggregated view summing the ai_games_won and games field by square, row, and column
8. Calculate the player win rate, i.e. games not won by the ai / games
9. Sort by the highest player win rate and select the top 10
10. [Output the data](data_prep/output_level_2_battleship_squares.csv)
