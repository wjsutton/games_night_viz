# Level 1: Player Select

Welcome! 

The theme for the first #GamesNightViz project is "Player Select", which follows the start of most games - choosing your character. 

Picking the right character can be a tricky decision, and we may want to bring in some data to help us select the best character for the job, we may want to know:
- what skills does this character have?
- what makes them different from everyone else?
- how likely are they to succeed based on past performances?

## The Challenges

Below are **three challenges** for you to choose from:
- [**Visualising data**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/1_player_select.md#data-visualisation-challenge) about our favourite **CHARACTERS**, with datasets ranging from gaming icons to top poker players
- [**Crafting designs**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/1_player_select.md#visual-design-challenge-colour) to explore **COLOUR**, with tools to help you create a unique colour palette
- [**Preparing data**](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/1_player_select.md#data-preparation-challenge-the-best-mario-kart) to find the **BEST MARIO KART** driver and kart combination, with steps to follow along the way

### Legendary difficulty - bring your own data

For those considering the Legendary difficulty (bring your own data), here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Do you have a favourite character?
- Did they appear in multiple match/games or is there one particular match/game that was interesting?
- Do they have particular strengths that gives them an advantage over others?

Looking for data sets? [Check out Sarah Bartlett's Twitter thread for data sources](https://twitter.com/sarahlovesdata/status/1445006106116374539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

| Data set Difficulty | Description |
|---|---|
| Casual | For those new to data visualisation or with limited time available |
| Normal | A fair size data set that could create multiple data visualisations |
| Heroic | A large data set for those with more time available  |
| Legendary | Expand on the data provided by bringing new data to the project |

## Visual design challenge: Colour

Colour is one of the most powerful tools for a data visualisation to connect with its readers/users. Colour allows us to distinguish and emphasize important parts of our data visualisation and well as creating an atmosphere for the work.

Here's an example by Andy Cotgrave, a clever switch of colour to create the [Same charts different message](https://gravyanecdote.com/data-2/changing-the-message-without-changing-the-data/)

<p align="center">
<a href='https://gravyanecdote.com/data-2/changing-the-message-without-changing-the-data/'>
  <img src = "https://gravyanecdote.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Same-charts-different-message.png" width="70%" class="center" alt="An image of the same chart twice, one in red showing the death toll in Iraq, the other blue rotated showing deaths in decline.">
</a>
</p>

### Task 
Using a colour palette tool create a unique colour scheme for a data visualisation. 

Some of my favourites colour tools
- [Adobe Colour](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
- [Datafam Colors](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ken.flerlage/viz/DatafamColors/StartPage)
- [Pokemon Colour Palettes](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/wjsutton/viz/PokemonColourPalettes/PokePalettes)

For more on inspiration on colour tools, read this great article by Lisa Charlotte Muth, [Your Friendly Guide to Colors in Data Visualisation](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorguide/)

Consider accessibility when experimenting with colour, you can create more accessible visualisations:
- using websafe contrasting colours: [WhoCanUse.com](https://whocanuse.com/)
- check how a colour blind person would see you viz: [Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).

### Inspiration from the Tableau community

Check out Louis Yu's recent Viz of the Day (VOTD), Bringing back the CHARM to Baltimore!

  <img src = "https://public.tableau.com/thumb/views/BringingbacktheCHARMtoBalitmore/LivabilityScores" width="40%" class="center">

Louis has taken colour design inspiration from The Sims to create a distinctive look and feel to the viz.

## Data preparation challenge: The best Mario Kart 

The holiday season is coming up, which means friends and relatives will be coming over and a chance you'll find yourself in a Mario Kart 8 tournament. To give me the best possibility of winning what's the best kart I could pick for my favourite character? Also, what's the best kart whether everything has been unlocked or not? 

For Mario Kart 8, at the start of the game you select:
- A driver
- Kart body
- Kart tires
- Kart glider

### Task

To work out the best combination of driver, body, tires and glider, we can source some data tables from [MarioWiki.com](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe_in-game_statistics)

1. [Input the data](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/data_prep/input_level_1_mario_kart_8.xlsx)
2. Long pivot the Driver, Kart body, Tires and Gliders tabs so each attribute becomes a row with the attribute value.
3. Join Driver, Kart body, Tires and Gliders together so we have 1 row per combination of driver, kart body, tires and glider
4. Create a total value (sum of the driver, kart body, tires and glider values) for each attribute
5. Drop the individual component values and create a wide pivot of the data spreading attributes into columns displaying the total values for each kart combination
6. Simplify the attributes:
- Sum all attributes as the overall total
- Sum all attributes starting with "S" for the overall speed
- Sum all attributes starting with "T" for the overall handling

7. Determine which components (driver, kart body, tires and glider) are available at the start of the game
8. Create a flag for any kart combination that requires an unlock, i.e. any components not available at the start of the game
9. Create a rank for each driver and if an unlock is required, ordered by the highest overall total descending, then by speed descending and handling descending
10. Filter the data so just the best kart for each driver and if an unlock is required
11. Optional: Join each component to an image so you know what to look out for in the game
12. [Output the data](https://github.com/wjsutton/games_night_viz/blob/main/data_prep/output_level_1_mario_kart_8.csv)
